### Project overview

ChatGPT Microservice is a small Java springboot app that integrates with the

Application exposes a set of APIs:
- [localhost:8500/api/v1/chat](http://localhost:8500/api/v1/chat)
- [localhost:8500/api/v1/transcription](http://localhost:8500/api/v1/transcription)

Application worked with some of the older API and java version, but a developer
who was building it left and the code is unfinished and doesn't work

You are tasked to make the project work. The API provided above
must be accessible via postman and must allow integration with ChatGPT and Whisper services.

In addition you should be able to create a simple JSP page and deploy in the local
Tomcat container to allow simple input of a prompt to ChatGPT.

Project must be built with `maven` and work with Java version 16+

You must be able to explain the code and the changes made. You must be able to 
find bugs in the code and fix them and explain what was not working and why.

### Submission rules


When finished, you will zip the code in the repository and send to `test@kolomolo.com`
or, alternatively, create your own public repository and give access to kolomolo by
sending and email to the same email address.
